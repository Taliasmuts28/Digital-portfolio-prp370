- **Situation:**  I completed a personality assessment activity as part of our Work Readiness Training to better understand my personal traits and how they affect my work style.
- **Task:**  I needed to analyze the results and reflect on how my personality influences my approach to teamwork, learning, and career goals.
- **Action:**  I reviewed my assessment results carefully, identified my strengths and areas for growth, and thought about how these traits have played out in my past experiences and projects.
- **Result:**  I discovered that I am empathetic and strong-willed, which helps me stay focused on my goals while understanding others. I work well in structured environments but can adapt when needed. This insight has helped me improve my teamwork skills and better align my personality with my career aspirations in ICT.
